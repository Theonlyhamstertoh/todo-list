* Utilize Single responsibility principle from SOLID
* Develop better the skill of pre-planning

## Things I wish I did differently ##
Although I managed to complete the project, there were times that I felt really frustrated because of getting confused by my code. I wish I maintai a more organized code, separated from one another instead of being entangled in one giant mess. 

### For My Next Project ###
* I want to make sure I plan ahead how I am going to organize my files
* Make sure I apply my 30 minute sessions more diligently
* Really plan and not jump right into the project
* Get a better grasp on webpack 
* Separate the functions from DOM manipulators and make sure they follow Object Oriented principles.
